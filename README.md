# todoer
The goal for the todoer project is to create a simple app that will work in the command line.

The app should display a menu that lets the user create a new list, open an already existing one or delete.
The user should also be able to simply quit.

The main "database" of lists should be saved in a .txt file.
The lists themselves should also be saved in simple .txt format in the app's folder.
Lists should be editable and provide task adding, marking as done and deleting functionality.
Lists should have names.

The user should be able to exit a list and go back to the menu.

Implemented so far:
    - Main menu
    - Display the master list (of lists)
    - Add new lists to the list
    - Open a list
    - Save lists
    - Quit

TO DO:
    - Add/delete tasks
    - Bad input handling
